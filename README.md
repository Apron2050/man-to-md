# man-to-md(1) - Converts nroff man pages to Markdown

Version 0.6, July 2017

# Description

This program is a filter
that reads nroff-formatted man pages
and outputs Markdown.
It can be used to automatically convert
man page files
to Markdown README files.

# Options


* **-p**, **--paste-after** *SECTION*:*FILENAME*  
  Instructs the program to attach a Markdown file
  after the section named *SECTION*
  has been completely written to the output.
  *SECTION* must be an exact match of the input section name.
  If the input contains no such section,
  the file will be attached to the end of the output.
  The attached file contents will have the exact *FILENAME* (without the **.md** extension)
  as their top-level section title.  
  This option can be supplied more than once.
  Multiple files for the same section will be attached in the options' order.
* **-P**, **--paste-before** *SECTION*:*FILENAME*  
  Like **--paste-after**,
  but attaches the file contents
  to the output
  just *before* the named section is written.
* **-c**, **--comment** [*COMMENT*]  
  Adds an invisible comment as first line.
  Without the argument, it uses this default comment:  
  “This file was autogenerated from the man page with 'make README.md'”.
* **-w**, **--word** *WORD*  
  Adds a *WORD* to the list of known words
  not to be titlecased in section titles.
  (All other words will be titlecased
  except some known English stopwords which will be lowercased.)  
  This option can be supplied more than once
  to add multiple known words.
* **-f**, **--formatted-code**  
  Allows simple formatting in **.nf**-**.fi** code blocks
  and in the Synopsis line.
  (Without this option,
  all formatting in code block and in the Synopsis line
  will be removed.)
* **-h**, **--help**  
  Shows program help.
* **-V**, **--version**  
  Shows version and license information.

# Standards

This program understands many nroff commands and macros commonly used in man page files.
For a complete list, see&nbsp;[doc/Commands.md](doc/Commands.md).

The program emits Markdown syntax
that should be readable with most Markdown editors/viewers.
See&nbsp;[doc/Markdown_Output.md](doc/Markdown_Output.md)
for more information.

The program makes several assumptions about the input format
that are not standardized
but seem to be fairly commonplace
in man pages; see&nbsp;[doc/Input_Format.md](doc/Input_Format.md).
