.SH TEXT BLOCK
This section contains regular text.
.P
But after a while,
well-formatted URLs
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URL)
show up!
.P
They may also end a
sentence
(https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/sentence).
.P
This URL is not in parentheses,
so it should not be its own link title
in the output:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URL
(plain url)
.P
Fin!
.SH AUTHOR
At least in this section, e-mail addresses
should automatically get converted to a link:
author@dummy.test
This should also work inside angle brackets:
<author2@dummy.test>
Fin!
